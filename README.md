"# TheCherno_OpenGL" 

Programs written in C using Win32 SDK and OpenGL while following along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2">The Cherno's YouTube Series on OpenGL</a>.

The only difference is that this repository contains all the programs written with Win32 SDK instead of SDL.
